# PracticalMLCourseProject

This holds the Rmd file and knitted output for the course project in the Johns Hopkins Practical Machine Learning course offered via Coursera.

The rendered (knitted) report can be viewed at the following link.
No code is shown in the report itself -- to see the code, please have a look at the Rmd file.

The Rmd source can be viewed at the following link, though the formatting is lost and there is no syntax highlighting.
It may be preferable to clone the repo locally, and open the Rmd file in RGui or RStudio.

One caution:  If you attempt to knit this, expect that it may need to run for an entire day to finish training the classifiers.
